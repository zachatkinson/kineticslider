## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          | End of Support    |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |

## Security Update Process

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. The process follows these steps:

1. Security issue is reported
2. Issue is confirmed and classified
3. Fix is developed and tested
4. Security advisory is drafted
5. Fix is released along with advisory
6. Users are notified through our security advisory feed

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of KineticSlider seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@kineticslider.dev](mailto:security@kineticslider.dev). 

### Response Timeline
- Initial Response: Within 48 hours
- Issue Classification: Within 72 hours
- Regular Updates: Every 72 hours until resolution
- Resolution Timeline: Dependent on severity (typically within 1-2 weeks)

If you don't receive a response within 48 hours, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### Required Information

Please include as much of the following information as possible to help us better understand the nature and scope of the potential issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Measures

KineticSlider implements the following security measures:

- Regular dependency updates and audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Code signing for all releases
- Security-focused code review process
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated testing for security-critical features

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure). This means:

1. Give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue you report before making it public
2. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
3. Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason beyond reporting it
4. Provide us with enough information to reproduce and fix the issue

## Security Updates and Commitments

We commit to:
* Responding to security reports within 48 hours
* Releasing security patches as soon as possible
* Maintaining a security advisory feed
* Keeping our dependencies up to date
* Regular security audits of our codebase
* Notifying users of security-relevant updates
