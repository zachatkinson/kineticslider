# KineticSlider Test Coverage Plan

## Current Testing Status

As of initial audit, the project has minimal test coverage. We've established a testing framework using Jest, but need to implement comprehensive tests across the codebase.

## Testing Priorities

Testing priorities are ranked by importance:

1. **Critical Components**:
    - Core KineticSlider component
    - Resource management to prevent memory leaks
    - Transition functionality between slides

2. **Interactive Features**:
    - Touch and swipe gestures
    - Mouse interaction for cursor effects
    - Navigation controls

3. **Visual Effects**:
    - Filter application and management
    - Displacement effects
    - Animation transitions

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
    - Sliding window management
    - Atlas texture support
    - Resource cleanup and garbage collection

## Component Testing Map

### Main Component
- `KineticSlider.tsx`: Test rendering, props acceptance, lifecycle methods

### Hooks
- `useSlides.ts`: Test slide management, loading, and transitions
- `useDisplacementEffects.ts`: Test displacement filter application
- `useTextContainers.ts`: Test text rendering and positioning
- `useMouseTracking.ts`: Test cursor tracking and displacement
- `useTextTilt.ts`: Test text tilt effects with mouse movement
- `useTouchSwipe.ts`: Test touch interaction and gesture handling
- `useNavigation.ts`: Test keyboard and button navigation
- `useResizeHandler.ts`: Test responsive resizing behavior
- `useIdleTimer.ts`: Test idle animation behavior
- `useFilters.ts`: Test filter application to sprites/text

### Managers
- `ResourceManager.ts`: Test resource tracking and cleanup
- `AtlasManager.ts`: Test atlas texture management
- `AnimationCoordinator.ts`: Test animation sequencing
- `RenderScheduler.ts`: Test render scheduling optimization
- `SlidingWindowManager.ts`: Test texture loading/unloading

### Filters
- `FilterFactory.ts`: Test filter creation and caching
- Individual filter files: Test effect application and parameters

## WebGL/PIXI.js Testing Considerations

Testing WebGL components requires special considerations:

1. **Canvas Mocking**: Using jest-canvas-mock to simulate the canvas API
2. **PIXI.js Mocking**: Creating mock implementations of PIXI classes
3. **Shader Mocking**: Simulating shader compilation and application
4. **Animation Testing**: Testing GSAP timeline creation and execution
5. **Memory Management**: Verifying resources are properly disposed

## Test Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure and Core Tests**
    - Set up Jest configuration ✅
    - Create mocks for PIXI.js and WebGL ✅
    - Implement basic component rendering tests
    - Test resource management and cleanup

2. **Phase 2: Hook and Logic Tests**
    - Test each hook individually
    - Test component integration with hooks
    - Test state management and transitions

3. **Phase 3: Visual and Interactive Tests**
    - Test filter applications and effects
    - Test interactive features and gestures
    - Test animation sequences

4. **Phase 4: Performance and Edge Case Tests**
    - Test with large numbers of slides
    - Test resource management under load
    - Test browser compatibility issues

## Coverage Goals

- **Target Coverage**: 80% overall code coverage
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 95% coverage for core functionality
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Specific tests for browser quirks and device limitations
